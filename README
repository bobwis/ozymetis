DEVELOPMENT/EXPERIMENTAL VERSION OF OZY <-> METIS PROTOCOL CONVERTER GATEWAY

The protocol converter was conceived inside ghpsdr3-alex source tree in a new sub directory. With this version it
has been extracted from the source tree and put into a single folder with a manually written makefile.

The usb and start-up routines are lifted from ghpsdr3-alex with some small modifications,
mainly around the I2C functionality.
Thanks to John Melton, G0ORX/N6LYT for the open source ghpsdr-alex code.

ozymetis is not presently integrated into ghpsdr3-alex but could be to give Metis functionality when
the user only has an Ozy board. The same applies for other SDR hosts that only support Metis at present.

For a Raspbian RPi2 user logged in as pi, wih the files extracted to a directory named ozymetis:-

cd /home/pi/ozymetis/

inside the ozymetis directory:

There are two Makefiles Makefile.x86 and Makefile.rpi2 for each platform.


The source code needs a tidy up, headers and defines re-arranging, build system etc.

To build:
	Needs usb libraries: libusb-1.0/- <exact detail to be added>

	Raspberry Pi 2 - Install gcc-4.8: apt-get install gcc-4.8
	X86 - nothing special

	make -f Makefile.rpi2  or make -f Makefile.x86

To use:

As superuser, plug in Ozy to the Pi's USB and run ./ozymetis Wait a good 5 seconds after seeing the messages
below before trying to discover the 'Metis' using PowerSDR or KISS etc

sudo ./ozymetis

	"Metis Listening for UDP datagrams on port 1024
	ep6 bytes =0, badcount=0
	ep4 bytes =0"

Connect to the Rpi2 protocol converter gateway using PowerSDR or KISS etc as if you had a Metis board. 

Note: WiFi discovery doesn't always seem to work. There are other known bugs, see listener.c


	The system is written for one HPSDR with one Mercury and a single PC, but could easily be enhanced

See the notes in listener.c (the main file doing the protocol conversion) for bugs and other comments. 

Good luck!
